        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <h1>Robots to improve people’s quality of life</h1>
        <p>PAL Robotics’ mission is to create disruptive service robots that enhance society’s quality of life and solve daily problems. Robotics can make a difference by collaborating with humans, providing support for domestic tasks and increasing efficiency in industrial workflows.</p>
        <br><p>We develop customizable, tailor-made platforms and modular robotic parts that adjust to people’s needs. We design and manufacture highly integrated and reliable solutions for service industries and research institutions worldwide.</p>
        <br><p>PAL Robotics started in 2004, when a small group of engineers built the first fully autonomous humanoid biped robot in Europe. With over 15 years of experience in R&D, today we are known for our humanoid and mobile robots used for research, logistics, retail and social applications for companies, institutions and labs.</p>
        <h3>VISI</h3>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
